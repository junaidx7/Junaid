                <h6>Competitor Analysis</h6>

                <p> I conducted a comprehensive competitor analysis, evaluating industry giants like Zoho Accounting and
                    Xero. This analysis empowered me to understand their strengths and weaknesses, enabling me to
                    strategically position our product. By learning from their approaches, I created a user-friendly and
                    feature-rich design that sets Nathan Digital Accounting apart. This thorough analysis ensured our
                    software not only competes but excels in the competitive landscape, offering users a superior
                    accounting solution.

                     <p class="bold_para">From this research, we gained some key insights: </p>
                     
                    <li>73% of survey respondents feel lost or overwhelmed at least some of the time when trying to
                        manage their eco-impact.</li>
                    <li>Feelings of guilt and anxiety are common. Users want help, but don’t want to feel judged.</li>
                    <li>Users don’t simply want to be told what to do—they want to be given action to take,
                        step-by-step, in a way that feels manageable.</li>
                    <li>84% would be interested in an app that provides guidance and recommendations.</li>

                    <p>Using these insights we crafted a persona, Camille, to capture the pain points and frustrations

                    <p> when designing Nathan Digital Accounting, meticulous attention was given to information
                        architecture, the backbone of a seamless user experience. By strategically organizing complex
                        financial data, categorizing transactions, and structuring the navigation flow, I ensured that
                        users could effortlessly comprehend and interact with the software. Clear categorization and
