        <h4>Setting the Goal.</h4>

        <div class="gap_m"></div>


        <p> The bar was set high; we aimed to compete with already-established industry giants such as QuickBooks and
            Xero. For this purpose, we sought to create software that not only accomplished user’s tasks efficiently but
            also proved to be more intuitive, user-friendly, powerful, and capable of seamless integration with
            Nathan-digital’s other ERPs.
        </p>

        <ul style="max-width: 80%;">
            <li>Intuitive task execution - Should be able to perform common task such as creating invoice & sharing
                invoice, Adding expense, running reports, and other tasks faster and in a more intuitive way.</li>

            <li>Don’t make the user think - Reduce cognitive load of the user as much as possible, for eg, when ever the
                system knows the data, it should auto populate the fields rather than user filling in the data.</li>

            <li>Don’t make user do it twice - Introduce features that automate repetitive tasks, saving users time and
                effort in their accounting processes.</li>

            <li>ERP integration: The software should integrate with companies' ERP products, providing a seamless
                workflow and eliminating the need to switch between multiple systems.</li>

            <li>Visually Appealing - The Interface should be visually appealing and must have a dark mode to reduce eye
                strain.</li>

                    <p> when designing Nathan Digital Accounting, meticulous attention was given to information
                        architecture, the backbone of a seamless user experience. By strategically organizing complex
                        financial data, categorizing transactions, and structuring the navigation flow, I ensured that
                        users could effortlessly comprehend and interact with the software. Clear categorization and
                        intuitive labeling empower users to swiftly locate crucial information, fostering a sense of
                        control and confidence in their financial management. The thoughtful information architecture
                        not only simplifies complex accounting processes but also elevates the overall usability, making
                        Nathan Digital Accounting an intuitive and user-friendly solution for businesses of all scales.

            <p> The bar was set high; we aimed to compete with already-established industry giants such as QuickBooks
                and
                Xero. For this purpose, we sought to create software that not only accomplished user’s tasks efficiently
                but
                also proved to be more intuitive, user-friendly, powerful, and capable of seamless integration with
                Nathan-digital’s other ERPs.
