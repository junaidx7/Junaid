    <!--Setting the goal---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

    <section>

        <div class="max-width">



            <h4>Setting the goal right ;</h4>


            <p> The bar was set high; we aimed to compete with already-established industry giants such as QuickBooks
                and Xero. For this purpose, we sought to create software that not only accomplished user’s tasks
                efficiently but also proved to be more intuitive, user-friendly, powerful, and capable of seamless
                integration with Nathan-digital’s ERPs.
            </p>

            <ul style="max-width: 80%;">
                <li>Intuitive task execution - Should be able to perform common task such as creating invoice & sharing
                    invoice, Adding expense, running reports, and other tasks faster and in a more intuitive way.</li>

                <li>Don’t make the user think - Reduce cognitive load of the user as much as possible, for eg, when ever
                    the
                    system knows the data, it should auto populate the fields rather than user filling in the data.</li>

                <li>Don’t make user do it twice - Introduce features that automate repetitive tasks, saving users time
                    and
                    effort in their accounting processes.</li>

                <li>ERP integration: The software should integrate with companies' ERP products, providing a seamless
                    workflow and eliminating the need to switch between multiple systems.</li>

                <li>Visually Appealing - The Interface should be visually appealing and must have a dark mode to reduce
                    eye
                    strain.</li>

            <p> For example, when creating a invoice, as soon as the customer is selected the customer’s contact

                having to type them. this drastically reduces cognitive load of the user and saves time.

            <h4>Usability Testing & </br> Iterations</h4>

            <p> The bar was set high; we aimed to compete with already-established industry giants such as QuickBooks
                and
                Xero. For this purpose, we sought to create software that not only accomplished user’s tasks efficiently
                but
                also proved to be more intuitive, user-friendly, powerful, and capable of seamless integration with
                Nathan-digital’s other ERPs.
            </p>

            <ul style="max-width: 80%;">
                <li>Intuitive task execution - Should be able to perform common task such as creating invoice & sharing
                    invoice, Adding expense, running reports, and other tasks faster and in a more intuitive way.</li>

                <li>Don’t make the user think - Reduce cognitive load of the user as much as possible, for eg, when ever
                    the
                    system knows the data, it should auto populate the fields rather than user filling in the data.</li>

                <li>Don’t make user do it twice - Introduce features that automate repetitive tasks, saving users time
                    and
                    effort in their accounting processes.</li>

                <li>ERP integration: The software should integrate with companies' ERP products, providing a seamless
                    workflow and eliminating the need to switch between multiple systems.</li>

                <li>Visually Appealing - The Interface should be visually appealing and must have a dark mode to reduce
                    eye
                    strain.</li>
